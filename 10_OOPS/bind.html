    /* bind method in JavaScript: creates a new function by setting 'this' keyword and optionally prepending arguments to the original functions.
        It is used to control the context (this) in which the function is executed, and is particularly helpful in scenarios where 'this' may otherwise be ambiguous 

    Syntax:
        let boundFunction = orgFunction.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)

        thisArg : value you want to set as 'this' inside the new function
