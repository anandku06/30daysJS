<!-- Traditionally, we use XMLHttpRequest for communication between client and server.
    XMLHttpRequest : an object used to interact wiht servers;
        one can retreive data from the URL without having to do a full page refresh; enables a WebPage to update just part of the page without disrupting what the user is doing.
        
        Used heavily in AJAX programming 
        
    AJAX(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) : not a technology, but rather an approach to using a number of existing technologies together, including HTML or XHTML, etc. and most importantly the XMLHttpRequest object.

    XMLHttpRequest.readyState -> property returns the state an XMLHttpRequest client is in. Some of the following states are :
    0 -- UNSENT -> Client has been created. open() not been called.
    1 -- OPENED -> open() has been called.
    2 -- HEADERS_RECEIVED -> send() has been called, and headers adn status are available.
    3 -- LOADING -> Downloading: representText holds partial data.
    4 -- DONE -> The operation is complete.
