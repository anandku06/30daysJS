<!-- Traditionally, we use XMLHttpRequest for communication between client and server.
    XMLHttpRequest : objects are used to interact wiht servers;
        one can retreive data from the URL without having to do a full page refresh; enables a WebPage to update just part of the page without disrupting what the user is doing.
        
        Used heavily in AJAX programming 
        
    AJAX(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) : not a technology, but rather an approach to using a number of existing technologies together, including HTML or XHTML, etc. and most importantly the XMLHttpRequest object.
