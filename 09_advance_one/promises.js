/* Promises in JavaScript -> an object represents the eventual
    completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

    Having three states:
    - pending -> initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected
    - fulfilled -> meaning that the operation was completed 
        successfully
    - rejected -> meaning that the operation failed
